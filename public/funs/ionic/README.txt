A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/mikkokam/pen/Geotz.

 DEMO for NUI. (Proof-of-concept prototype now).

Modules to enable any DOM element to respond to drag and multi-touch, accelerometer input or calculations from a 2D PHYSICS engine to include gravity, collisions, inertia, friction etc.

NO CANVAS. Plain DOM elements: The boxes in Box2D demo are plain div elements with a single attribute added, no additional javascript needed, NUI will make them real dynamic objects.
